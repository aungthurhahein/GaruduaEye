## Troubleshooting

### SMS Alerts Not Working

1. **Check Twilio Configuration**

   - Check for typos in the phone number

3. **Service Issues**
   - Ensure SMS service is running (`npm start`)
   - Check console logs for error messages
   - Verify network connectivity

### Exchange Rate Data Issues

1. **API Limitations**
   - Free APIs have rate limits
   - Some APIs require registration
   - Consider upgrading to paid services for production

2. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Look for CORS issues in browser console

## Customization

### Modifying Alert Logic
Edit the `checkAlerts()` method in `script.js` to customize when alerts are triggered.

### Adding New Chart Periods
